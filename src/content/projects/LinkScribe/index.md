LinkScribe is a web application that uses NLP to allow users to create and organize lists of links easily and efficiently. With LinkScribe, you simply copy and paste a web link, and the application will automatically process it, extracting information about the content of the page and ranking it accordingly. You will have the option to save the link to your personal list or simply search for another one, and you can also check the links you have previously saved.
